/*

Floats are represented in 32 bits (one word) and 
doubles in 64 bits (two words). 

Floats represent 6 significant digits while a double represent 
10 significant digits. This means that floats aren't very accurate and 
lose precision in calculations when compared to doubles. 

It's almost always right to use double instead of float.
